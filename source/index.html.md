Get back to the basics with static sites! Static sites rely only on well-known, tried-and-true web technologies &mdash; HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Moreover, they are easy to scale and can be hosted cheaply or even for free in many places such as Amazon S3 or [Pancake](https://pancake.io).

However, writing in HTML all the time can be a little tedious. That's where **static generators** come in. They make it easy to create static sites by cleanly separating content from layout, while lacking complex servers to configure. With a generator, you can focus on what is important.

Static generators are a **front-end developer's best friend**. These guides are designed to introduce you to different static generators and help you find one you like. They cover the basics of adding content, using layouts, and integrating things like SASS and CoffeeScript.
